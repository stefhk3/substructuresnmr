# when using the last push of the code in the master branch, there are flags to be set.

# save_best_in_fold         is the flag to toggle when the models need to be saved or not

# save_models_num_folds      is the number of folds 

# minimum_accuracy = "75".   is the threshold for which models are required to be saved. Currently this is set to 75.

# The saved models' names include their accuracies, hence the undesirable models can be removed from the directory if wanted.
