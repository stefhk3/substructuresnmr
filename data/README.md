Most data come from http://www.bmrb.wisc.edu/ftp/pub/bmrb/metabolomics/entry_directories/ HMBC and HSQC images have been downloaded. Some structures have no HMBC spectra. Those are: bmse000227, bmse000502, bmse000509, bmse000957 (fatty acid), bse000097, bmse000177, bmse000207, bmse001017 (indol). In the steroid folder, there are two structures which come from nmrshiftdb2.

All spectra have been edited in the following way:
- converted to jpeg
- converted to greyscale if colours were used
- Any scales and grids were removed
- scaled to 600x410 pixels (those dimensions seemed the most common ones)
- The image area was extended (or in some cases cropped to cover the area of 0-10/0-200 ppm. This was only done approximately, so it is not possible to overlay spectra directly.

In the test folders there are some artificial mixtures by overlaying spectra (the names are like x_y_z, where x, y, and z indicate that the spectrum is bmse000<x|y|z>_1H_13C_<HSQC|HMBC>.png originally). Those have been produced by exactly overlaying the original images using the scales. The scales were removed afterwards and the images edited as above.
